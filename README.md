# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It works through three key mechanisms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. ML models learn from training data, optimize performance using mathematical functions, and generalize knowledge to unseen data. The process includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. 


  **1.Superwise Machine Learning :-**
        Regression is a type of supervised learning used to predict continuous numerical values based on input data. 
       The model learns from labeled datasets with input-output pairs and finds relationships between variables. 
       Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. 
       Regression is used in real-world applications such as house price prediction, stock market forecasting, and sales trend analysis.
