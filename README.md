# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It works through three key mechanisms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. ML models learn from training data, optimize performance using mathematical functions, and generalize knowledge to unseen data. The process includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
